# Catch the connection

Ever tried to catch a train connection in Paris ? This is how it feels like

I wrote the original version of this game in 5 days for the [Raylib's NEXT game jam](https://itch.io/jam/raylib-next-gamejam).

I'll keep working on it, refactoring the code into something less horrifying, possibly fixing a few bugs.

This is my first C program, so don't look at this code unless you have a strong stomach.
